Taking a Self-Paced Course
###########################

Many courses are instructor-paced: they follow a schedule that the instructor
sets, with assignments and exams that have specific due dates. In contrast,
self-paced courses allow you to progress through the course at your own speed.

    On the edx.org home page, an indication next to the course start date lets
    you know if a course is self-paced.

************************************************************
Differences between Instructor- and Self-Paced Courses
************************************************************

Instructor-paced courses follow a set schedule. Course materials become
available at specific times as the course progresses. Assignments have due
dates, and exams have start and end dates. On the **Course** page, indicators
show assignments that are graded, and their due dates.

Self-paced courses do not follow a set schedule. Course materials do not become
available according to a schedule, but are completely available as soon as the
course begins. Assignments and exams do not have start or due dates. The
**Course** page shows indicators for assignments that are graded, but not due
dates.

In self-paced courses, you can submit an assignment or exam at any time before
the course end date.
